The module SIM7600E-H, developed by SIMCom, is a 4G/3G/2G LTE module that comunicates via UART commads using an intern parser described on the module datasheet. 
The waveshare Board with the module, comes with a set of extra functionalities for extra support to the module normal usage.

The following image, taken from the Waveshare board datasheet, lists the hardware features.
